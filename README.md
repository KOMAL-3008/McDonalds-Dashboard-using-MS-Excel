# McDonalds-Dashboard-using-MS-Excel

I created this interactive and insightful dashboard using Excel, integrating multiple data visualizations to present key business metrics effectively. Here's an overview of the features:
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): At the top, I displayed crucial KPIs such as Sales, Profit, and Customers, represented with eye-catching donut charts for quick understanding. This allows users to instantly grasp performance with percentage metrics (Sales: 85%, Profit: 89%, and Customers: 87%).
Sales Trends Graph: A line chart showcasing the sales trends for 2025-2026, offering a clear view of performance fluctuations over time. By comparing two different years, it reveals valuable insights into sales growth or decline.
Sales by Countries: This map visualization breaks down sales by country, emphasizing Brazil as the leader with $553.2M in sales. The geographical representation makes it easy to identify regional performance.
Customer Satisfaction: A Treemap chart is used to display various satisfaction metrics like Availability (95%), Hygiene (93%), and Quality (86%), highlighting the strengths and areas that need improvement like Service (53%) and Speed (54%).
I also incorporated hyperlinks on key visuals to allow further drill-down analysis or navigation to other relevant data sheets, enhancing the interactivity of this dashboard.

Tools Used:-
Microsoft Excel for data visualization
Conditional formatting and gauge charts for performance metrics
Line chart, treemap, and map visualizations for clarity in data representation
This dashboard demonstrates the power of Excel in creating meaningful, interactive reports without needing complex tools
